# PCET-pH-kinetic-model
The pH dependence of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions is a powerful probe for elucidating their fundamental mechanisms. The PCET-pH-kinetic-model is the code for a general, multi-channel kinetic model for describing the pH dependence of PCET reactions that can be applied to both homogeneous and electrochemical reactions.
